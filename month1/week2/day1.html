        //Function - a block of code that does a specific task. It takes some data as input and you can display the output.
        // This is a way of reusable code and a procedural way of encapsulation.

        //Function is declare this way:
        function square(number) {
            return number * number;
        }
        //It starts by declaring function followed by the name of the function which is "square" with 1 parameter inside the
        //open-close parenthesis called "number". It returns the value of the data inputted in the function the multiplies itself.

        console.log(square(6));
        //When calling the function or using it, and if it has a parameter, it is a must to enter an input or what we call "argument"
        //which is "6" so when it executes the program, it will call the square function and will return the value of "36"
        //because the parameter we sent is 6 and it returns the 6 * 6.
        //To sum up, parameter is a placeholder and argument is the value that we pass for a function to run.


        function myFunc(theObject) {
            return theObject.make = "Toyota";
            //make is property of the myCar object.
        };

        const myCar = {
            make: "Honda",
            model: "Accord",
            year: 1998,
        };

        console.log(myCar.make);
        //Displays Honda since its inside the object already.

        myFunc(myCar);
        //Using the myCar object as an argument for the myFunc function.

        console.log(myCar.make);
        //Displays Toyota since it used the make property as reference it passed what is inside the function return value.
        
        
        function myFunc(theArr) {
            return theArr[0] = 30;
        };

        const arr = [45];

        console.log(arr[0]);
        //Displays 45 since its inside the object already.

        myFunc(arr);
        //Using the arr as an argument for the myFunc function.

        console.log(arr[0]);
        //Displays 30 since it used the index 0 as reference in the array and passed what is inside the function return value.
